Maria: Thank you for calling ACME TELCO, this is Maria, how may I assist you today?

Alex: Hi Maria, I'm Alex and I'm interested in your new 5G service. I'm currently with another telco provider but I'm considering switching over to ACME TELCO.

Maria: Great to hear that, Alex. Our 5G service offers faster download and upload speeds, low latency, and improved coverage. Do you have any questions or concerns about the service?

Alex: Yes, I do. Can you tell me more about the coverage and network reliability?

Maria: Of course, our 5G network covers most major cities and we're continually expanding our coverage. Our network is also reliable, and we use the latest technology to ensure that you have a seamless experience.

Alex: What about the pricing? How does it compare to other telco providers?

Maria: Our pricing is competitive and we offer a variety of plans to suit different needs and budgets. We also have a special discount offer for new customers who switch over to ACME TELCO.

Alex: That sounds great! Can you tell me more about the discount offer?

Maria: Sure, if you switch over to ACME TELCO, you'll get a 20% discount on your monthly bill for the first 6 months. And if you sign up for a 2-year contract, you'll also get a free 5G phone.

Alex: That's a good deal. I think I'm ready to switch over to ACME TELCO.
